Medistats - Behavioral Disorder Detection in Children using Machine Learning


This project aims to develop a real-time web application powered by a machine learning model. The application allows parents to answer diagnostic questions about ADHD, Dyslexia, Autism, and other behavioral disorders. Based on their responses, the model evaluates the data and predicts whether the child is at risk of developing these conditions.

Problem Statement

Behavioral disorders such as Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, Dysgraphia, Dyspraxia, Autism, and ADHD often manifest with mild symptoms in early stages, making early diagnosis challenging. These disorders involve multiple complex factors and typically require extensive diagnostic methods, including:

1. Assessment by a specialist

2. In-depth interviews with parents and children

3. Evaluation of the childâ€™s medical history, background, and symptoms

However, these methods may not always provide early-stage diagnoses, and parents often do not seek psychiatric help for minor initial symptoms. Additionally, there are limited digital tools to assist in identifying these conditions at an early stage.

This project proposes a digital platform designed to detect these disorders when symptoms are still mild, allowing for early intervention and better management.

Novelty of the Project

This web-based predictive analysis tool is unique, as no other digital solutions exist for the early diagnosis of these behavioral disorders specifically for children. Our machine learning model has been trained using a custom dataset created through extensive research and surveys. Since no publicly available datasets existed for these disorders, our dataset is an exclusive asset that enhances model accuracy. This project combines high-level predictive analysis with original survey-based dataset collection, making it a pioneering effort in this field.

Real-Time Usage

1. The web application will feature an intuitive interface where parents can input observations about their child's behavior. The system will function as follows:

2. Parents respond to specific diagnostic questions regarding symptoms and duration of observations.

3. The input data serves as test data for the machine learning model.

4. The pre-trained machine learning model, developed using historical data and research, processes the input.

5. The model predicts the likelihood of the child having one or more behavioral disorders.

6. The results are displayed on the web interface, providing parents with insights into potential risks.

Working Mechanism

The system follows a structured pipeline:

1. ollection of Dataset: Gathering data from surveys, medical sources, and research.

2. Selection of Attributes: Identifying key indicators relevant to each disorder.

3. Data Pre-Processing: Cleaning, formatting, and structuring the dataset.

4. Balancing of Data: Ensuring the dataset is well-balanced for unbiased predictions.

5. Model Training: Applying various classification algorithms to train the model.

6. Disease Prediction: Using trained models to analyze real-time input and predict potential disorders.

The GUI interface is currently under development and will be integrated soon.
